This "JoystickToDrive" command was written to connect the Joystick inputs to the Drivetrain subsystem.
It uses the arcadeDrive method from DifferentialDrive in Drivetrain to control the motors of the drivetrain.
These comments are meant for rookies to learn what the basic structure of the Command here should be.
